# Frame  

## Frame build log  

The frame is based on arcade sizing, a 3x3 grid of 11" * 11" squares, resulting in a 33" * 33" or 838.2mm * 838.2mm square, excluding the area for mounting the bar.  
My frame is built entirely from 70mm * 45mm timber, then attatched to a 1.2m * 1.2m sheet of 12mm thick plywood.  
I figured the 90~mm height that comes with a more standard 2" * 4" or 90mm * 45mm wouldn't benifit the pad in anyway, though choose based on availability.  
Measurements will need to be changed if using timber not Xmm * 45mm.

Using these measurements we get the required lengths to build the base pad, excluding the area to the bottom for the bar.  
>This is somewhat dependant on your bar mounting system and as I'm playing chairmod until I can obtain my bar I've opted to leave this section out  
Alternatively you can ignore it all together and build just the pad itself  

| QTY | Length | 
|-----|--------|
| 2 | 828mm |
| 4 | 748mm |
| 2 | 234mm |
| 4 | 212mm |

All the lengths of wood cut and rough edges sanded down.  

![Holes drilled](/frame/img/IMG_20200328_175741.jpg)  
Drilled holes in all the inner pieces for cable routing using a 22mm spade bit.  
And a 25mm hole drilled at 140mm in from the outside edge, along one of the 838mm peices to mount the neutrik NAUSB-W connector.

The frame itself was screwed and glued together using G10 x 100mm countersunk timber screws while taking care to ensure it was well aligned and square.

Then screwed to the ply base using 60mm countersunk wood screws, these were quite a mix of various leftovers but worked out fine.  
You can see the screw placement here.
