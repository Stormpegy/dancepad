The wiring of the pad is quite simple, wired no different to if you were using arcade sensors, a common ground on all and a dedicated pin for each on the Arduino, in this case analog pins 1-4.  

An Arduino leonardo r3 was chosen due to the easily mountable standard form factor and using an atmega32u4 with full native usb support.  
Other recommended boards are the Arduino micro, Sparkfun pro micro and teensy 2.0.  

I believe there is also code being developed for the teensy 4.0 which uses an ARM cortex controller.  
Purchase what is readily available and suits you, my personal preference is a chinese leonardo clone.

(this will be updated along with the addition of LEDs at a later date)  

I also opted

I also opted to route a length of old ethernet cable to underneath each arrow panel for future use with leds and possibly more sensors.
