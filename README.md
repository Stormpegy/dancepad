# Dancepad  
## note  
I'm releasing this build log early as i feel it's at a stage where it will be helpful to some people even with the missing information, no point keeping it hidden while i continue to slack on finishing it  

03-08-2020, lets see how long till the log actually gets finished

## Overview  
4 panel dance pad for DDR/ITG.  
I've been planning this project since 2017/2018 and never got anywhere until the covid pandemic of 2019/2020 hit, I'm glad to have finally made progress and gotten myself a playable dance pad.  

Before this project started I was passing ITG 13s and I've now pushed up to 14s and nearing the 15 range, it's certainly capable!    

Key features and goals of this project,  
- velostat sensors  
    - cheap  
    - adjustable sensitivity without the need to lift arrow panels  
- bracketless  
    - less parts
    - no need to source steel corner brackets from an arcade supplier  
- affordable build 
    - basic timber frame construction  
    - 3d printed parts  

The relatively simple timber frame with plywood base of this build along with using cheaper galvanised steel rather than stainless keeps the cost fairly low, the frame itself totaled $120aud.  
The panels are polycarbonate I got cut to size and drilled + countersunk them myself for a total of $80aud.  
The electronics for this dance pad are quite simple, with just a $10aud Arduino Leonardo clone from ebay, a sheet of velostat, some wires and a few basic connectors.  
Full cost table is WIP

## Pad to do list  
- Chamfer all edges of the arrow panels  
- Obtain a bar and construct a mount for it  
- Disassemble the entire pad and paint the frame  
- Order arrow panel decals  
- Order v5 led strips for underneath the arrow panels  
- Construct an arcade thickness edging around the pad  

## Guide to do list  
- Finish electronics page
- Proof read everything  
- Ensure formatting is consistent  
- Ensure punctuation even exists  
- Pricing table
