## Overview
Open source 4 panel dance pad for DDR/ITG.
I've been planning this project since 2017/2018 and never got anywhere until the covid pandemic of 2019/2020 hit, I'm glad to have finally made progress and gotten myself a playable dance pad.  

As with all my rhythm game related projects, huge thanks to the cons&stuff discord community, so much knowledge on any sort of homebuilt rhythm game controller you could ever want.

Key features and goals of this project,
- velostat sensors
    - cheap
    - adjustable sensitivity without the need to lift arrow panels  
- bracketless  
    - no need to source and countersink steel corner brackets
    - fancy and modern
- relatively simple and cheap build
    - timber frame construction
    - 3d printed parts

The relatively simple timber frame with plywood base of this build along with using cheaper galvanised steel rather than stainless keeps the cost fairly low, the frame itself totaled $120aud.  
The panels are polycarbonate I got cut to size and drilled + countersunk them myself for a total of $80aud.  
The electronics for this dance pad are quite simple, with just a $10aud Arduino Leonardo clone from ebay, a sheet of velostat, some wires and a few basic connectors.
>no bar yet because can't travel to pick it up

For the sake of not having an overly cluttered main page I'm going to separate this guide in to sections with images and a more detailed cost and design breakdown in each page.
